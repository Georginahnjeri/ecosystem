Welcome to my project, “Exploring Trends in the Indian Startup Funding Ecosystem.” Here, I delve deep into the Indian startup landscape, conducting a thorough analysis of data spanning from 2019 to 2021. India recently celebrated the 7th anniversary of the startup India initiative,and the release of the National Startup Report 2022 has brought to light a staggering growth and remarkable achievements in the country's startup ecosystem over the past seven years (2015-2022). The report showcases a 7x increase in the number of incubators, a 9x increase in the number of investors, and an impressive 15x increase in the total funding for startups.
With over 1,17,000 startups, the country has witnessed an exponential growth in entrepreneurship. These startups are not confined to metropolitan areas, as the report indicates their presence in 670+ districts, with 50% of them originating from Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities
Leveraging the power of Python and data visualization through Power BI, as a data analyst in this venture, aspire to uncover captivating trends within the expansive funding landscape of Indian startups. Join me on this exploration as we unravel the story behind the numbers, shedding light on the intricate patterns that have shaped the financial journey of startups in India during this critical period.
